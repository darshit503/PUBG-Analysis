The main aim of this Project is to show the Statistics of the Player and Game which shows behavior and analysis based on different factors such as Skydiving Position, Game time, and behavior based. 

Applied several Steps for this project which includes 
1. Data loading and exploration
2. Data PreProcessing
3. Feature Engineering
4. Statistical Analysis based on game and player
5. Model Building and Evaluation

The Basic Loading and Exploration includes Data Loading and Exploration in the form of CSV where data is being downloaded from Kaggle and it includes multiple Features and Attributes that explain about the included Features 


A Beginner in a learning phase can clean the data and apply some EDA, which is Exploratory Data Analysis, which helps clean the raw data and make it useful for further analysis. The main challenge of this Project is to handle the data understand the reliability of data and maintain its quality

After applying EDA we have to do Feature Engineering which is extracting the Feature from a single Feature also known as Feature Extraction. This Feature Engineering will include some Encoding Methods which means applying some techniques to have more Numerical Data (One Hot Encoding). 


The feature Engineering process has ended and then we jump towards the Outlier removal which can be done by using the Z-Score Method or some other. This Method helps in removing the data that are out of space for a particular variable or Feature. 
Several Analyses are done after manipulating the outliers and various Data Analysts apply some Methods that help in finding out what the data is telling to the audience. A Story is formed when these kinds of Analyses are created. 

Some Machine Learning Algorithms are used to find out further accuracy and to know about the data. After applying some Algorithms the Model let us know the data evaluation and how it can be used for further process.
